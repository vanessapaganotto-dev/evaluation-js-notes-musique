# Musical Notes Conversion (Classical → American)

## Description

This project offers a simple web interface to convert musical notes from the classical French notation (do, ré, mi, etc.) to the American notation (C, D, E, etc.).

The form is dynamically created and injected into the page via JavaScript. When a note is selected, the American equivalent is displayed instantly without page reload.

- Mapping between classical and American notation  
- Immediate display of the result below the form  
- Lightweight interface, no backend needed

## Project Contents

- `index.html`: minimal HTML page, content injected by JavaScript  
- `script.js`: JavaScript script that creates the form, manages selection, and displays the corresponding note

## Installation and Usage

- Copy the files to a folder accessible by a web server or open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.
